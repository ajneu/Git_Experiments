= Create commits with the shell or with libgit2

* https://github.com/ajneu/git_experiments/tree/master/automate_commits/go.sh[`automate_commits/go.sh`]
 shows which steps are needed to produce the successive commits shown in the
 section http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows#Topic-Branches[Topic Branches]
 (from the https://github.com/progit/progit2[progit2] book), to end up with the structure of <<image1,Figure 1>>.

* https://github.com/ajneu/git_experiments/tree/master/automate_commits/libgit2/go.cpp[`libgit2/go.cpp`]
  shows how to create the commits of <<image1,Figure 1>>, using https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2[libgit2].
  This example is just a very raw hack (a first look at libgit2). If you like C++ you should definately take a look at https://github.com/ajneu/unique_ptr_raii_to_c_code[unique_ptr_raii_to_c_code], which might make working with libgit2 C interface somewhat nicer.
